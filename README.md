## App architecture

A collection of templates to discuss and showcase different architectural tools and patterns for apps in different languages.

- It is a project that develops the source code gradually through the application of coding conventions and clean architecture after writing apps in various types of languages.

#### Description

To explain this project in more detail, it is a project that creates a simple app from HTTP, database, and login to the main screen, then considers the reusability of each module, creates a structure, and continuously develops the source code structure. .
The ultimate goal of this project is to continuously study various design patterns and create template source code that can quickly and easily create maintainable apps through separation between UI and business logic.
